  - title: "Final Year Project â€“ Pneumonia Detection Web App"
    description: 
      - Built a pneumonia classification model using transfer learning with DenseNet121 and custom CNN layers
      - Trained on labeled chest X-ray images to classify pneumonia vs. normal with high accuracy
      - Integrated into a Django-based web app for real-time image upload and AI-powered diagnosis
      - "Technology Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, DenseNet121, Transfer Learning, Deep Learning, Django"
  - title: "Intelligent RAG Chat System with Memory Management"
    description: 
      - Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for real-time context-aware conversations using FAISS for semantic search
      - Used Sentence Transformers for embedding generation and OpenAI API for natural language processing
      - Designed a modular microservices architecture with background workers for summarization, embedding, and PostgreSQL-based session management
      - Built to support scalable, concurrent chat processing with vector search capabilities
